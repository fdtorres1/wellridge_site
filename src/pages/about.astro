      <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif font-bold mb-6">Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <strong class="text-slate-deep">Strategy-first, structure always.</strong> Every winning proposal starts with understanding funder priorities and aligning your work to their goals. But alignment alone isn't enough—you need systematic processes, clear narratives, and evidence-backed budgets that build trust.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        We don't just write proposals. We build partnerships that extend beyond submission to reporting, renewals, and long-term stewardship. Our goal is to help you develop internal capacity while we handle the complexity.

      <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Felix Torres is the founder and principal of Wellridge Advisory. With deep experience in grant writing, RFP response, and nonprofit strategy, Felix brings a systematic approach to proposal development that prioritizes funder alignment and organizational capacity-building.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Before founding Wellridge, Felix worked with organizations across the nonprofit, municipal, and educational sectors, helping them secure millions in funding through strategic proposals and thoughtful stewardship. He believes that winning grants isn't just about strong writing—it's about understanding funder priorities, building trust through evidence, and creating structures that scale.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          When not writing proposals, Felix can be found exploring the intersection of strategy, narrative, and impact—and sharing those insights through the Wellridge Advisory blog.
