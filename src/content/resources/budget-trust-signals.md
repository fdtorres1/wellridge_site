# Budget Trust Signals Checklist

Use this checklist before submitting your budget to ensure it signals credibility and attention to detail.

## Salary & Personnel

- [ ] All salaries show FTE calculations (e.g., "0.5 FTE = 50% of $70,000 = $35,000")
- [ ] Salary levels are appropriate for role and geographic area
- [ ] Benefits are calculated as percentage of salaries (typically 20-30%)
- [ ] Staff time aligns with project activities and timeline

## Indirect Costs

- [ ] Basis for indirect calculation is documented
- [ ] If not requesting indirect, explanation is provided

## Alignment with Narrative

## Cost Reasonableness
