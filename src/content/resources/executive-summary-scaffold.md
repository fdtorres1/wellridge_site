## Tips

1. **Write this last**—it should summarize your strongest points.
2. **Keep it under 300 words**—reviewers scan quickly.
3. **Use active voice**—"We will serve" not "Services will be provided."
4. **Be specific**—numbers, timelines, and concrete details.
5. **Stand alone**—if a reviewer only reads this, they should understand your proposal.
