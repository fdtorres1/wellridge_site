Most grant writers assume reviewers read proposals from start to finish, carefully considering every word. The reality is different—and understanding how reviewers actually read can dramatically improve your win rate.

## The Review Process

Reviewers typically follow this pattern:

1. **Executive Summary** (30-60 seconds)
2. **Budget** (1-2 minutes)
3. **Program Description** (3-5 minutes)
4. **Organization Background** (1-2 minutes)
5. **Supporting Materials** (skim)

Total time: 10-15 minutes for a typical foundation grant.

## What This Means for Your Proposal

### Lead with Impact
Your executive summary must stand alone. If a reviewer only reads that section, they should understand:
- What you're proposing
- Why it matters
- How much you need
- What success looks like

### Budget Tells a Story
Reviewers check budgets early to assess feasibility and alignment. A well-structured budget that matches your narrative builds trust. A budget with red flags (unrealistic costs, missing line items) creates doubt.

### Program Description Needs Structure
Reviewers scan for key information:
- Clear problem statement
- Evidence-based solution
- Measurable outcomes
- Realistic timeline

Use headings, bullet points, and white space to make scanning easy.

### Organization Background Builds Credibility
This section answers: "Can this organization actually deliver?" Include:
- Relevant experience
- Key staff qualifications
- Past successes
- Organizational capacity

## Practical Tips

1. **Write the executive summary last**—it should summarize your strongest points.
2. **Use the budget as a narrative tool**—ensure every line item supports your story.
3. **Structure for scanning**—headings, bullets, and short paragraphs.
4. **Front-load key information**—don't bury important details in paragraphs.
5. **Make it easy to find answers**—reviewers are looking for specific information.

## The Bottom Line

Reviewers are human. They're busy, they're scanning, and they're looking for reasons to say yes or no. Structure your proposal to make it easy for them to say yes.
