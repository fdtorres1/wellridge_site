Every grant opportunity looks promising at first glance. But not all opportunities are worth your time. The 7-Minute Go/No-Go Rule helps you make a quick, data-driven decision before you invest hours in research and planning.

## The Framework

Spend exactly 7 minutes evaluating these five criteria:

### 1. Funder Alignment (2 minutes)
- Does the funder's mission align with your work?
- Are their stated priorities a match for your programs?
- Have they funded similar organizations or projects?

**Go if:** Strong alignment on mission and priorities.

### 2. Eligibility (1 minute)
- Do you meet all stated eligibility requirements?
- Are there geographic, organizational, or programmatic restrictions?
- Is your organization type eligible?

**Go if:** You meet 100% of eligibility requirements.

### 3. Capacity & Timeline (2 minutes)
- Can you realistically meet the deadline?
- Do you have the internal capacity to gather materials and provide inputs?
- Is the timeline compatible with your other priorities?

**Go if:** You have sufficient time and capacity.

### 4. Request Amount & Match (1 minute)
- Is the request amount appropriate for your organization size?
- Can you meet any match requirements (cash or in-kind)?
- Is the funding level worth the effort?

**Go if:** Amount is appropriate and match is feasible.

### 5. Competition & Win Probability (1 minute)
- How competitive is this opportunity likely to be?
- Do you have a competitive advantage?
- What's your estimated win probability (be honest)?

**Go if:** Win probability is at least 30-40% or higher.

## The Decision

**Go** if you score 4-5 "Go" criteria.  
**No-Go** if you score 2 or fewer "Go" criteria.  
**Maybe** if you score 3 "Go" criteria—revisit in 1-2 weeks with more information.

## Why This Works

The 7-Minute Rule forces you to be honest about fit and capacity before you invest significant time. It's not about perfection—it's about making a quick, informed decision that saves you from pursuing low-probability opportunities.
